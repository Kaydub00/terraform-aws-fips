# FIPS endpoints for AWS terraform provider

I went through the docs and put this all together so anyone going through FedRAMP or FISMA using terraform and AWS will have an easier time. Use these endpoints to meet FIPS validated security controls.

I have tested some of these endpoints but not all. If you find any discrepancies please put in an MR with the fix
